- How to start a new project 
 - create a folder 
 - create a virtual environment inside the folder command - python3 -m venv "virtual_environment_name"
 - install new libraries command - pip install library_name
 - after installing everything freeze the requirments command - pip freeze > requirments.txt
 - if there is already requirments file the command - python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
 - start version control command - git init

 - I am too lazy to write project description (code is self explainatory and not super complicated)
